# LightExperiment

Simple raytracing program. Closely follows the guide [RayTracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

Generates .ppm image files.

Run by the command "./render > output.ppm".

# Example
Example of generated result:

<img src="Output/bg2_hd.png" alt="Example" width="540" height="1170"/>

High resolution and number of samples.
Took roughly an hour to generate on a single thread on a budget laptop from 2014.

# Ideas for further development
- Add multi-threading
- Output directly to PNG
